            <ul>
                <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
                <li>1 cup warm water</li>
                <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons milk</li>
                <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
                <li>4 1/2 cups bread flour</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic (optional)</li>
                <li>1/4 cup butter, melted</li>

            <h2>Recipe Directions:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Let stand about 10 minutes, until frothy. Stir in
                    sugar, milk, egg, salt, and enough flour to make a soft dough. Knead for 6 to 8 minutes on a lightly
                    floured surface, or until smooth. Place dough in a well oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and set
                    aside to rise. Let it rise 1 hour, until the dough has doubled in volume.
                </li>
                <li>Punch down dough, and knead in garlic. Pinch off small handfuls of dough about the size of a golf
                    ball. Roll into balls, and place on a tray. Cover with a towel, and allow to rise until doubled in
                    size, about 30 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>During the second rising, preheat grill to high heat.</li>
                <li>At grill side, roll one ball of dough out into a thin circle. Lightly oil grill. Place dough on
                    grill, and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until puffy and lightly browned. Brush uncooked side with
                    butter, and turn over. Brush cooked side with butter, and cook until browned, another 2 to 4
                    minutes. Remove from grill, and continue the process until all the naan has been prepared.
